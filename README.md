<h2>Key Features:</h2>

- Adjustable game settings (bet amount, number of lines)

<h2>Functionality:</h2>

- Deposit: Players start by depositing their initial playing amount.

<h2>Future Improvements:</h2>

- Implement sound effects for winning and losing.
- Create winning animations (visual or text-based).
- Explore adding more special symbols or bonus features.

<h2>How to Run</h2>
